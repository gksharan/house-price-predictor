# 🏠 My First House Price Predictor!

Hey there! 👋 This is a simple, fun project I made to **predict house prices** using a basic machine learning model called **Linear Regression**.  
It’s a perfect starter if you're getting into **data science** and want to understand how things actually work!

### ✨ What This Project Does

- 🏷️ **Predicts Prices**  
  It guesses a house's price just by looking at its size (area in square feet). Pretty cool, right?

- 📈 **Draws a Graph**  
  It creates a simple plot to show actual vs predicted prices.

- 🧠 **Super Easy Code**  
  The code is beginner-friendly with helpful comments to follow along easily.
